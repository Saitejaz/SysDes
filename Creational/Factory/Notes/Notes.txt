Factory Design Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern

To simply say, we decouple the object creation part from main class/concrete classes, so in this way client code able to requests for objects, but not able to see how they are implemented.




Simple Factory [Design Principle]
---------------
Def : Creating an Object with out exposing the instantiation logic to client(Main Method/UI/Whoever it is trying to create those objects)
Client->Factory->Product


Factory Method [Design Pattern]
--------------
Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which classes to instantiate.
                               -> Concrete Creator Product A ->    
Client -> Creator(Abstarct) ->                                 -> Product
                               -> Concrete Creator Product B ->


Abstract Factory Method [Design Pattern]
