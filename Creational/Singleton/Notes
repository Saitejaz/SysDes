Singleton is a Creational Design Pattern

It ensures that only one instance of it's kind exists and provide a single point of access to it through any part of our application.

Singleton objects encapsulates it's attributes in one single class and guarantee that only instance of this class will be available at any point in time.

??WHY WE NEED SUCH OBJECTS IN PLACE??
( To control access to some shared resource )

## Example

Think of a Database, we only create a single instance of this Database and use through out our application, instead of creating multiple instances. So by this way, we can ensure that retrivel access of the data from DB is bit faster and error prune.

??WHEN WE WANT TO APPLY THIS PATTERN??

1. Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.

2. Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables.
