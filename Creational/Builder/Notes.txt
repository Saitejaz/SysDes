Builder Design Pattern : Seperation of construction of an objects from it's representations

So try to understand the words :
 1. Seperation of Construction   ->  Constructors are seperated from concrete class and store in Builder class
 2. From Objects Representation  -> Concrete classes are the Object representationers


So we construct the constructor seperately and pass it to the class for which we need an object. So from that constructor we can create required object(representer)

Example : Say you have a HTTPRequest class, which accepts 3 parameters(required) and optional are set through setters method.

1.Required values can set through constructor, but optional we cannot guarantee.
    To solve this we can go ahead with creating setters method for optional parameters.
2.But, Problem arises when you want all the parameters required and optional both and you forgot setting 
    optional and sending a request! We will compile safely, but API won't serve with any response.
    But But there will be a runtime Error (Inconsistent state).
3.To avoid above(2) problem we can validate it before calling an api request, but the validations which we are writing
    they are scattered and they are too much and in future they may cause problems for us to maintain.




Why we approach for Builder Pattern Design
1.Complex constructor and overloading ( Telescoping)
2.Inconsistent state (run time errors) if we are not setting values in constructors
3.Scattered validations to validate all the values of class members.


So we can define this Builder Design Pattern in 3 Ways
    1.Builder Involved
    2.(Buidler + Director[optional]) Involved
    3.Step Builder

Prerequisite : You should be aware of this keyword (current class reference)
